TODO's v3:

- Think of a better PS1; remove ENV from PS1; add DEBUG (?)
- Remove implicit use (and therefore requirement) of ENV
- Reconsider DEBUG levels
- Reconsider 'INSTALL_SCRIPT_NAMES' (maybe simply rename with 'DO'?)
- Reconsider '_cfg*' functions; maybe introduce a more concise SQL variant
  which makes things easier to read
- Remove exit confirmation on non-zero exit code (maybe just report it, possibly in the prompt)
